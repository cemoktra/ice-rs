# ice-rs #

The goal of this project is to support Rust in [ZeroC Ice](https://github.com/zeroc-ice/ice). Currently just client features are implemented. An ice file with python server code is added to test client features.

The goal is to add parsing/generating when a good structuring of the output code is found.
