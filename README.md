# ice-rs #

The goal of this project is to support Rust in [ZeroC Ice](https://github.com/zeroc-ice/ice). The current state is demonstrating the call to any language server of the minimal [demo](https://github.com/zeroc-ice/ice-demos).
Therefore only some protocol messages are implemented and no code generation is done. The network packages are manually created.
